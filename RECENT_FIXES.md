# Recent Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Shopping List Name Synchronization ✅
**Problem**: Custom shopping list names (like "test") weren't appearing in the shopping lists overview.

**Root Cause**: Frontend caching and race conditions between creation and refresh.

**Solution**:
- Added force refresh parameter to `fetchShoppingLists()` in store
- Clear cache after generating new shopping list
- Improved error handling and debugging
- Backend test confirms names are saved correctly

### 2. ESLint Warnings ✅
**Problem**: Multiple unused variable warnings in FamilyManagementPage.vue and CategoriesPage.vue.

**Solution**:
- Renamed unused `error` parameters to `err` and added console.error logging
- Removed unused `member` parameter from `editMember` function
- Removed unused `defaultIngredientCategories` constant

### 3. Categories Page Functionality ✅
**Problem**: Categories page was using mock data and localStorage only.

**Solution**:
- Connected to real API data via `useRecipeStore`
- Real ingredient/recipe/tag counting from actual data
- Combined API data with custom localStorage categories
- Added proper loading states and error handling

### 4. Meal Plans Error Handling ✅
**Problem**: Persistent "Failed to load meal plan" error appearing.

**Solution**:
- Added `clearError()` method to meal planning store
- Clear errors before loading meal plans
- Force refresh on load to get latest data
- Better error state management

### 5. Family Management System ✅
**New Feature**: Complete family/multi-user meal planning system.

**Implementation**:
- Backend: Family models, API endpoints, permissions
- Frontend: Family store, management page, invitation system
- Role-based access control (Admin/Member/Viewer)
- Email-based invitation system

## Technical Improvements

### Caching Strategy
