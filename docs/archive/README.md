# Archived Documentation

This folder contains old documentation files that are no longer actively maintained but kept for historical reference.

## Why Archived?

These files were created during development and deployment troubleshooting but are now superseded by:
- [Technical Design Document](../TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md)
- [Deployment Guide](../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- [12-Factor App Documentation](../12_FACTOR_APP.md)

## Contents

- **Deployment Status Files**: Historical deployment issues and fixes
- **Debug Files**: Troubleshooting documentation from development
- **Feature Guides**: Now consolidated into Technical Design
- **Fix Summaries**: Historical bug fixes and changes

## Current Documentation
