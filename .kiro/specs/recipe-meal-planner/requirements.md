# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Recipe Meal Planner is a comprehensive application designed to help users organize their recipes and plan their meals effectively. The system will initially support importing recipes from PDF files and later expand to include database-driven recipe management. Users will be able to store, categorize, search, and schedule their recipes for meal planning purposes.

## Requirements

2. WHEN text is extracted from a PDF THEN the system SHALL parse recipe information including title, ingredients, and instructions
3. WHEN recipe parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL save the recipe to the user's collection
4. IF a PDF cannot be processed THEN the system SHALL display an error message with guidance
5. WHEN a recipe is successfully imported THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation with the parsed recipe details

### Requirement 2

4. WHEN a user searches for recipes THEN the system SHALL filter results by title, ingredients, or tags
5. WHEN a user selects a recipe THEN the system SHALL display the full recipe details in a readable format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a meal planner, I want to schedule recipes for specific days and meals, so that I can plan my weekly meals in advance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses meal planning THEN the system SHALL display a weekly calendar view
2. WHEN a user selects a day and meal slot THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of a recipe from their collection
3. WHEN a recipe is assigned to a meal slot THEN the system SHALL display the recipe title in the calendar
4. WHEN a user views a planned meal THEN the system SHALL show the full recipe details
5. WHEN a user wants to modify meal plans THEN the system SHALL allow moving or removing recipes from meal slots
6. WHEN a user successfully adds a meal THEN the system SHALL close the add meal dialog and NOT reopen it automatically
7. WHEN a user cancels adding a meal THEN the system SHALL close the add meal dialog without saving changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a grocery shopper, I want to generate shopping lists from my meal plans, so that I can efficiently purchase ingredients for my planned meals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a shopping list THEN the system SHALL compile ingredients from all planned meals for a specified date range
2. WHEN ingredients are compiled THEN the system SHALL consolidate duplicate ingredients with combined quantities
3. WHEN a shopping list is generated THEN the system SHALL display ingredients organized by category (produce, dairy, etc.)
4. WHEN a user views the shopping list THEN the system SHALL allow marking items as purchased
5. IF ingredient quantities cannot be combined THEN the system SHALL list them separately with source recipe names

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to be prepared for future database integration, so that I can eventually access a larger recipe database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system architecture is designed THEN it SHALL support pluggable recipe sources
2. WHEN recipe data is stored THEN the system SHALL use a consistent data model for both PDF and future database recipes
3. WHEN the system processes recipes THEN it SHALL handle recipes from multiple sources uniformly
