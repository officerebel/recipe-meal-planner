# üîç Deployment Debug Guide

## Issue: iPhone Still Shows Demo App

Even in private browser, you're seeing the old demo version. This suggests:

1. **Deployment Issue**: The latest code might not be deployed
2. **CDN Caching**: Railway's CDN is serving old files
3. **Multiple Deployments**: There might be different versions

## üöÄ Current Deployment Status

- **Frontend URL**: https://mealplannerfrontend-production.up.railway.app
- **Latest Deployment**: Just triggered a new deployment
- **Expected**: No demo mode, clean production interface

## üì± Immediate Test Steps

### 1. Wait 5 Minutes
The deployment is currently running. Wait 5 minutes for it to complete.

### 2. Test on iPhone Private Browser
1. **Close Safari completely** (swipe up, swipe Safari away)
2. **Open Safari** ‚Üí **Private browsing**
3. **Go to**: https://mealplannerfrontend-production.up.railway.app
4. **Look for**: Clean login/register interface (NO demo buttons)

### 3. Test Different URL Variations
Try these URLs to see if there are multiple deployments:
- https://mealplannerfrontend-production.up.railway.app
- https://proud-mercy-production.up.railway.app (this is backend)

### 4. Check for Demo Mode Indicators
**OLD VERSION (Demo)** has:
- "Enable Test Mode" buttons
- Automatic demo login
- Blue info banners about demo mode

**NEW VERSION (Production)** has:
- Clean login/register forms
- No demo mode buttons
- Professional interface

## üîß If Still Showing Demo Mode

### Option 1: Force New Deployment
I can trigger a completely fresh deployment with a version bump.

### Option 2: Check Railway Dashboard
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Check if deployment succeeded
- Look for any error messages

### Option 3: Alternative Testing
- Try on a different device
- Try Chrome browser on iPhone
- Ask someone else to test the URL

## üéØ Expected Result After Fix

When working correctly, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Clean production interface
- ‚úÖ No demo mode buttons
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication required
- ‚úÖ Correct PDF recipe matching

**Next Step**: Wait 5 minutes, then test the URL in iPhone private browser. If still showing demo mode, let me know and I'll investigate further.
